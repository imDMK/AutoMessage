 * Represents a declarative task definition used by the {@link TaskScheduler}.

 *     <li>a delay before the first execution ({@link #delay()}),</li>
 *     <li>an optional repeating period ({@link #period()}).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Instances are consumed by scheduler methods that accept {@link PluginTask},
 * allowing tasks to be declared as self-contained objects instead of passing
 * raw parameters into every scheduling call.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Repeating vs. non-repeating:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>If {@link #period()} returns {@code Duration.ZERO}, the task is executed once after the delay.</li>
 *     <li>If {@link #period()} is greater than zero, the task is executed repeatedly.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Threading:</strong> Whether the task runs synchronously or asynchronously
 * depends solely on the {@link TaskScheduler} method used (e.g., {@code runTimerSync}, {@code runTimerAsync}).</p>
